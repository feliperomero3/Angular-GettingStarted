# Angular Getting Started

Coding along with [Angular: Getting Started][angular-course] by Deborah Kurata at Pluralsight.

[Starter project][starter-project] provided by Deborah Kurata hosted at GitHub.

**NOTE**: this particular codebase has some minor differences with the course version.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Run

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
